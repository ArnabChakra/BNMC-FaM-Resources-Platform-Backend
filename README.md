## Description

🔍 YouBe-Healthy specializes in providing various health related resources that aim to improve the well-being of our members. Among our initiatives is the implementation of the Medically Tailored Meals program, which was developed by the NYS DOH. Through our application of this program as an \"In Lieu of Services\" offering, we strive to reduce inpatient and emergency visits for members with specific conditions and ultimately enhance their health outcomes. Additionally, we have launched the FoodFirst program, which addresses food deserts by providing free grocery delivery to members' homes in identified areas.
